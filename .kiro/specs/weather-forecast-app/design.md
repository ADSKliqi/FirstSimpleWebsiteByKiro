# Weather Forecast App Design Document

## Overview

The Weather Forecast App is a client-side web application that provides users with current weather conditions and 5-day forecasts for searched locations. The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns between data fetching, UI components, and error handling.

**Key Design Principles:**
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile devices
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- Fast response times (≤5 seconds for weather data retrieval)
- Accessible interface with proper contrast and readable fonts

## Architecture

The application uses a modular JavaScript architecture with the following high-level structure:

```
Weather App
├── UI Layer (HTML/CSS/JS)
│   ├── Search Interface
│   ├── Current Weather Display
│   └── Forecast Display
├── Service Layer
│   ├── Weather Service (API integration)
│   └── Location Service (search validation)
└── Utility Layer
    ├── Error Handler
    └── Loading Manager
```

**Architecture Rationale:** This layered approach ensures maintainability and testability while keeping the codebase simple for a client-side application.

## Components and Interfaces

### 1. Search Interface Component
**Purpose:** Handles user input for location searches and validation

**Key Features:**
- Input field with validation for city names
- Search button with loading states
- Auto-focus and enter key support

**Interface:**
```javascript
class SearchInterface {
  constructor(onSearch)
  validateInput(cityName)
  displaySearchError(message)
  showLoadingState()
  hideLoadingState()
}
```

### 2. Weather Service
**Purpose:** Manages API calls to weather service and data transformation

**Key Features:**
- Integrates with OpenWeatherMap API (or similar)
- Handles API key management
- Implements timeout for 5-second requirement
- Transforms API responses to application format

**Interface:**
```javascript
class WeatherService {
  async getCurrentWeather(cityName)
  async getForecast(cityName)
  handleApiError(error)
}
```

**Design Decision:** Using OpenWeatherMap API for reliable weather data with good geographic coverage and reasonable rate limits for a demo application.

### 3. Location Service
**Purpose:** Validates location input and handles location-related operations

**Key Features:**
- Input format validation
- Location name standardization
- Error handling for invalid locations

**Interface:**
```javascript
class LocationService {
  validateLocationInput(input)
  formatLocationName(name)
}
```

### 4. Current Weather Display Component
**Purpose:** Renders current weather conditions

**Key Features:**
- Temperature display in Celsius
- Weather condition description
- Weather icon display
- Additional metrics (humidity, wind speed)

**Interface:**
```javascript
class CurrentWeatherDisplay {
  render(weatherData)
  updateTemperature(temp)
  updateCondition(condition, icon)
  updateMetrics(humidity, windSpeed)
}
```

### 5. Forecast Display Component
**Purpose:** Renders 5-day weather forecast

**Key Features:**
- Daily forecast cards
- High/low temperatures
- Weather icons for each day
- Date formatting

**Interface:**
```javascript
class ForecastDisplay {
  render(forecastData)
  createDayCard(dayData)
  formatDate(date)
}
```

## Data Models

### Weather Data Model
```javascript
const WeatherData = {
  location: {
    name: string,
    country: string
  },
  current: {
    temperature: number,
    condition: string,
    description: string,
    icon: string,
    humidity: number,
    windSpeed: number
  },
  forecast: [
    {
      date: string,
      highTemp: number,
      lowTemp: number,
      condition: string,
      icon: string
    }
  ]
}
```

**Design Rationale:** This normalized structure separates current conditions from forecast data while maintaining consistency in temperature and condition representations.

## Error Handling

### Error Types and Responses

1. **Location Not Found**
   - Display: "Location not found. Please check the spelling and try again."
   - Action: Clear search field, allow retry

2. **Service Unavailable**
   - Display: "Weather service is currently unavailable. Please try again later."
   - Action: Show retry button

3. **Network Connection Error**
   - Display: "Connection error. Please check your internet connection and try again."
   - Action: Show retry button

4. **API Timeout (>5 seconds)**
   - Display: "Request timed out. Please try again."
   - Action: Show retry button

### Error Handler Implementation
```javascript
class ErrorHandler {
  static handleWeatherError(error)
  static displayError(message, showRetry = true)
  static logError(error, context)
  static clearError()
}
```

**Design Decision:** Centralized error handling ensures consistent user experience and simplifies debugging through structured logging.

## Responsive Design Strategy

### Breakpoints
- **Desktop:** ≥1024px - Full layout with side-by-side current weather and forecast
- **Tablet:** 768px-1023px - Stacked layout with full-width components
- **Mobile:** 320px-767px - Single column layout with optimized touch targets

### Layout Adaptations
- **Search Interface:** Full-width on mobile, centered on desktop
- **Weather Display:** Card-based layout that stacks vertically on smaller screens
- **Forecast:** Horizontal scroll on mobile, grid layout on desktop

**Design Rationale:** Mobile-first approach ensures optimal performance on all devices while maintaining usability across screen sizes.

## Performance Considerations

### Loading States
- Search button shows spinner during API calls
- Skeleton loading for weather data sections
- Progressive enhancement for forecast data

### Caching Strategy
- Cache weather data for 10 minutes to reduce API calls
- Store last searched location in localStorage
- Implement simple request deduplication

### API Optimization
- Single API call for current weather + forecast when possible
- Implement request timeout (5 seconds) as per requirements
- Graceful degradation if forecast data fails but current weather succeeds

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing Focus Areas
1. **Location Service:** Input validation and formatting
2. **Weather Service:** API response handling and error scenarios
3. **Error Handler:** Error message generation and logging
4. **Data Transformation:** API response to application model conversion

### Integration Testing
1. **End-to-End Search Flow:** Complete user journey from search to display
2. **Error Scenarios:** Network failures, invalid locations, API timeouts
3. **Responsive Behavior:** Layout adaptation across breakpoints

### Manual Testing Checklist
- Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Mobile device testing on actual devices
- Accessibility testing with screen readers
- Performance testing with slow network conditions

**Design Decision:** Focus testing on critical user paths and error scenarios rather than comprehensive coverage, given the application's scope and client-side nature.
